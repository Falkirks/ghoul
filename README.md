ghoul
=====
ghoul is a "native" filesystem abstraction library for PHP. It is not your grandmother's abstraction library.

### What does this do?
ghoul overrides built-in filesystem methods, so you don't need to change any code.

### But that is evil, what happened to proper code standards?
You're using PHP.

### Can I turn off goul?
Yes. But that wouldn't be fun.
